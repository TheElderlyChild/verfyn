# verfyn
Verfyn is an initiative to refine problem solving. 
Verfyn is still in its inception/early stages of development.

Its goals are to:

- Identify and demonstrate common problem solving methods(PSM)
- Create and formalise terminology for these PSM, their relationships and combinations
- Communicate its problems, research and results to the public
- Integrate these solutions into education
